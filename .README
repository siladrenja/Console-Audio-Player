This is just a small project I'm doing for fun, it is capable of being used as an actual audio player, 
and I use it as such, but user friendliness, is not my main concern, as intendend audience is... well, me.

A lot of features that aren't really fully implemented yet(such as playlists) are still available, as, as I said, I know they don't work,
and I don't need to specify it for myself.
